In the world of Single Page Applications, client-side rendering has long been the go-to method for rendering content. However, as SPAs have evolved, other rendering modes have emerged that offer different advantages and disadvantages. In my talk, we will explore why it's important to go beyond a blank page as initial request and explore different rendering modes like SSR, SSG, ISG and more.

We'll not only cover the pros and cons of each mode but also provide real and comparable examples. By the end of the talk, you'll have a better understanding of the different rendering modes available for SPAs, and be able to choose the best one for your needs. Join me to explore the art of rendering modes.
