JavaScript is evolving quickly - like web development in general. But often, you don't have time to catch up with the latest features, improvements, planned changes, and best practices. This workshop will help you to get up to speed with the latest JavaScript features and best practices.

Join us for a comprehensive workshop on Modern JavaScript, where we will explore the evolution of the language from ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to the latest ECMAScript proposals (ESNext). JavaScript is constantly evolving, and staying up-to-date with the latest features and best practices is essential for developers in today's fast-paced web development landscape.

In this workshop, we will delve into the key advancements and language enhancements introduced in ES6 and progress through the subsequent iterations, providing hands-on experience and practical insights that will empower you to write more efficient, maintainable, and expressive JavaScript code. Whether you are a seasoned JavaScript developer looking to sharpen your skills or a newcomer eager to learn, this workshop will equip you with the knowledge and tools needed to excel in the world of Modern JavaScript.

## Target audience and requirements

This workshop targets developers who are already familiar with JavaScript and want to learn more about the latest features and best practices. Participants should know features up to (excluding) ES6 / ES2015. Otherwise, the [Beginner JavaScript Workshop](/workshops/javascript-beginner) is recommended first or in combination.

## Format

This workshop is a **hands-on workshop**.

Instead of the typical workshop flow, you will work through the exercises before I'll teach you the theory and background. This way, you will learn the most important concepts of Nuxt.js by doing and not by listening or copying lines of code from the slides.

After each exercise, we will go through the solution and theory together, reinforcing what you have learned.
